                <p>Hey, I was doing just fine before I met yo I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
                    Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet theBut I hope I never see them again
                    I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
                    Four years, no call Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and I-I-I can't stop No, I-I-I can't
                    stop
                    So, baby, pull me closer In the back seat of your RoverThat I know you can't afford
                    Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of that mattress that you
                    stole
                    From your roommate back in Boulder
                    We ain't ever getting older We ain't ever getting older We ain't ever getting older
                    You look as good as the day I met you
                    I forget just why I left you, I was insane
                    Stay and play that Blink-182 song
                    That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
